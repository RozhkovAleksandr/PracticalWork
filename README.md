# PracticalWork
Welcome to the project! 
## Requirements

To use the functionalities provided in this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

### For TCP, COAP, and HTTP Packet Sending
- [Scapy](https://github.com/secdev/scapy)
- [WebSockets](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

To install these libraries, you can use the following commands:


```
pip install scapy
pip install websockets
```




### For apromixing functions
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)

You can install these libraries using the following commands:

```
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
```

## Folder Structure

1. **SendingPackeges**
   This folder contains the necessary scripts and utilities for sending packets over TCP, COAP, and HTTP protocols. It utilizes Python's Scapy library for packet manipulation and WebSockets for efficient communication.

2. **ApromixingFunctions**
   In this folder, you'll find functions related to signal processing. It requires NumPy for efficient array manipulation and SciPy for advanced mathematical functions.
